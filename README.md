# OOPS Banner App

This application is designed to demonstrate various ways to print an "OOPS" banner to the console using Java.

## Feature Branches

The following feature branches were used during development, each addressing a specific Use Case (UC):

- **feature/UC1-printHello**: Implements the basic functionality to print "OOPS" to the console.
- **feature/UC2-Banner_Display**: Extends the application to print a stylized "OOPS" banner to the console.
- **feature/UC3-Banner_strjoin**: Implements the banner printing logic using the `String.join` method for more efficient string handling.
- **feature/UC4-Banner_strloop**: Implements the banner printing logic using loops to construct and display the "OOPS" banner.

After a feature is coded, it is merged with the develop branch.
